## Overview
### Description
Progress through increasingly difficult levels of bug smashing mayhem. "flys" will flash on the screen that you can press on to collect points. Enough points will progress you to the next level. Failure to press a fly within a certain amount of time, or clicking a "beetle", will result in a game over.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Games
- **Mobile:** Used for mobile, but would work for a computer too.
- **Story:**  An ineractive game for passing the time by clicking on bugs.
- **Market:**  Anyone who is bored.
- **Habit:**  User can play as long as they want.
- **Scope:**  At first maybe the flys and beetles will just flash on the screen without moving.  As the app progresses maybe we could apply movement to the bugs.  And implement a way of detecting when the user misses a bug and taps on the white background accidentally, deducting points.
